Strategic thinking

Basic programming (when remade in Python, for example)

Target Audience - Who is this for? (ex: students, gamers, young adults, etc.)

Ideal for:

Family game nights

Classroom logic games

Solution + Limitations - How does your project solve the problem? Are there actions your program would do to solve the problem but doesn’t do?

. Improves Strategic Thinking and Planning
Players must think ahead, anticipate the opponent’s moves, and plan their own.

This builds problem-solving and decision-making skills, which are useful in school, work, and everyday life.

Technical Challenges + Future Plans - What was hard to figure out? What do you wish you could add if you had more time or more experience?

coding connect 4 from scratch was extremely difficult considering, i had no real idea how to start. i was using a computer that couldnt really handle all the lines of code that was written and on top of that i had limited acess to certain features used to make coding easier since i was using techsmart

i plan to finish the game as it is incomplete and needs working

Project Timeline - Briefly explain how you broke this project up across days, weeks, or months.
this project took me alomost a year, i spent atleast 3 months figuring out what components, functions and ikmports i would need to use, then i spent time figuring out the conce3pot of the code i was going to write, then i spewnt time writting the code, debugging it, upgrading parts, starting over and trying multiple methodes

Tools and Resources Used - Include websites, docs, vid
i used google docs and youtube
